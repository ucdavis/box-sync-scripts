Midnight Box Sync Scripts
=========================

This repository holds the sync scripts used to parse two CSV files and create the
necessary groups and group members in Box.com using their API.

It is written in Ruby and uses the 'boxr' gem. It was tested using Ruby 2.3.1p112
with 'boxr' version 1.1.0.

Setup
-----
1. Ensure you have Ruby and the popular Ruby utility 'bundler' installed.

  $ ruby -v
  
    ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-darwin15]

  $ bundle -v
  
    Bundler version 1.11.2

  If you do not have bundler, try 'gem install bundler'.

2. Obtain your Box.com OAuth2 information. Documentation at
  https://docs.box.com/docs/oauth-20. Remember your client ID and
  client secret. Set your redirect URI to http://localhost/.

3. Visit https://account.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&state=security_token%3DKnhMJatFipTAnM0nHlZA
  and you should be redirected to CAS, prompted to Grant Access, and then redirected
  to a non-existing localhost page. At this point, you have 30 seconds to perform the
  next web request. Copy the erroneous URL and extract from it the 'code' parameter.

4. Still within the 30 second window, hit this URL using curl:
  curl https://api.box.com/oauth2/token -d 'grant_type=authorization_code&code=THE_CODE_YOU_RECEIVED&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET' -X POST
   
   and you should receive a response like:
   
   {"access_token":"something","expires_in":3664,"restricted_to":[],"refresh_token":"something_else","token_type":"bearer"}
   
 5. Edit the file credentials.yml and fill in your client ID, client secret,
   as well as the access token and refresh token you received in the JSON from
   step 4.
 
 6. Run the make_groups_with_instructors.rb first. Ensure your CSV is in the correct
   format, e.g.
   
   "FACULTY_NAME", "FACULTY_EMAIL", "COURSE", "CRN"
   "John Smith","john.smith.fake@ucdavis.edu","ABC 123 001","12345"
   
   Note that the first line (the "header") should not be present in the CSV file.
   
   Note that the script creates groups with "-S16" at the end. You will need to
   edit the script to change the term. As of this writing, it is on line 66.
   
   The script itself can be run like so:
   
   ruby ./make_groups_with_instructors.rb the_file.csv
   
 7. Run the make_students_in_groups.rb script. Note it has a slightly different
   CSV format and you may need to repeat steps 3-4 to update your access and refresh
   tokens.
   
   The CSV format is:
   
   "ABC123-001-201603","12345","Johnny Student","johnny.student.fake@ucdavis.edu"
   
   Again, you can run the script like so:
   
   ruby ./make_students_in_groups.rb the_student_file.csv
 
 In 2016, the faculty CSV was 4069 lines and took under two hours to complete.
 The student CSV was 119684 lines and took around 11 hours to complete.
